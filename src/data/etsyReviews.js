    quote: 'I used this study guide to study for only a few weeks before I took my NAPLEX and passed!!! The information was concise, and well organized. Everything I needed to know clinically was on there. Great to supplement with UWorld\'s qbank as well which is what I did! Highly recommend getting this guide not only for NAPLEX but to keep as a resource for your career as well!',
